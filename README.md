# leaf_classification

This project is a part of the IFT712 course at Universit√© de Sherbrooke. It was made in collaboration with [Alexandre Theisse](https://github.com/AlexTheisse).

The goal of this project is to classify leaves from images using several machine learning algorithms available in the `scikit-learn` library. The dataset used is the [Folio Leaf Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification/data) from Kaggle.
